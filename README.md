WORKFLOW PROBLEM: FACTS
=======================

I am working with a collaborator who wants to keep our repos separate. 
He has paths in his code that are unique to his machine

I edit the build instructions and the machine-specific paths and commit them.
I can put the build instructions in a gitignore, but how do I deal with the other
changes?
